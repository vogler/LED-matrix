# LED-matrix

16x16 pixel RGB LED matrix with support for [WLED](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED) and text (digits only for now).

Price for components was about 18â‚¬ (see [comment](https://www.mydealz.de/deals/divoom-pixoo-pixelart-display-16x16-nft-foto-frame-inkl-akku-1954933#comment-35482339)).

Use WLED and its interfaces for controlling the light and showing effects.
To show digits (which WLED can't), see `wled.py` which sends pixel information to WLED via UDP.

Run a server taking commands via MQTT on `lights/wled-matrix` with `python3 wled.py mqtt`.
Commands are `on, off, num 123, co2`.

Grid and case were designed in Fusion 360: https://a360.co/36UBWL9

You can 3D print the `.stl` files in `models`.
Beware of warping (visible in top right corner below).

01.03.22 Created this repo and [extracted commits](https://www.pixelite.co.nz/article/extracting-file-folder-from-git-repository-with-full-git-history/) from [smart-home](https://github.com/vogler/smart-home/search?q=wled&type=commits):
```console
$ cd smart-home
$ git log --pretty=email --patch-with-stat --reverse --full-index --binary -- audio-reactive-led-strip wled.py > ../patch
$ cd ../LED-matrix
$ git am < ../patch
```

19.02.23 Was still commiting to `smart-home/wled.py` instead of here. Extracted new commits, deleted the file there and added this repo as a submodule.

Also noticed that GitHub showed 'Mar 1, 2022' for all extracted commits.
Reason was that AuthorDate was correct, but CommitDate was set to the time of amend operation. Normal `git log` shows AuthorDate, `git log --pretty=fuller` also shows CommitDate which is what GitHub uses.
Fix was to use `git am --committer-date-is-author-date`. However, had to get rid of the commits with the wrong date first, and then redo:

```
$ cd ../smart-home
$ git log --pretty=email --patch-with-stat --reverse --full-index --binary -- audio-reactive-led-strip wled.py > ../wled.patch
$ # split it into wled1.patch (up to Nov 9 2021) and wled2.patch (from Nov 12 2022)
$ cd ../LED-matrix
$ git log --pretty=email --patch-with-stat --reverse --full-index --binary > ../led-matrix.patch
$ # delete commits that are also in wled.patch from led-matrix.patch
$ git reset b3d14b1f3fea1b708972e8da08000790efedad8c # go back to 'Initial commit'
$ git am --committer-date-is-author-date < ../wled1.patch
$ git am --committer-date-is-author-date < ../led-matrix.patch
```
