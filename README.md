# LED-matrix
16x16 pixel RGB LED matrix with support for [WLED](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED) and text (digits only for now).

Price for components was about 18â‚¬ (see [comment](https://www.mydealz.de/deals/divoom-pixoo-pixelart-display-16x16-nft-foto-frame-inkl-akku-1954933#comment-35482339)).

Use WLED and its interfaces for controlling the light and showing effects.
To show digits (which WLED can't), see `wled.py` which sends pixel information to WLED via UDP.

Run a server taking commands via MQTT on `lights/wled-matrix` with `python3 wled.py mqtt`.
Commands are `on, off, num 123, co2`.

Grid and case were designed in Fusion 360: https://a360.co/36UBWL9

You can 3D print the `.stl` files in `models`.
Beware of warping (visible in top right corner below).
